# buckdemo

A demonstration of how to set up an iOS monorepo with [Buck](https://www.buck.build).

## Prerequisites

In order to build using Buck, you first need to install it using Homebrew.

```
brew tap facebook/fb
brew install buck
```

## The project

The project contains a very simple iOS app consisting of a single screen. The project is divided into packages. 
`app` contains the main application project. `common` is a tiny framework depended on by `app`.

In each package you will find a `BUCK` file containing the build rules for that package. At the project root
you will find a `.buckconfig` file containing build settings.

These buck files are a source of truth and are used by Buck to build the project. 

## Using Xcode

Buck can generate an Xcode workspace from the build definitions. If however the build definition changes, it is
important the workspace is regenerated.

The workspace can be generated by

```bash
buck project app:BuckDemoApp
```

Xcode can then be used to build and run the app as usual.
